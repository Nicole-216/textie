# textie
Textie is my first ever application and I am learning to code. Currently, Dart is my primary language and Flutter is the first framework I am using. 
My goal to become a game programmer. So, I think that would mean I have to learn Java, Solidity, Unreal Engine, and a bunch of other seemingly weird languages and frameworks.
Hold on, did I mention that I am currently 14?
Yea, I am... getting quite old. My back hurts. Lol.
